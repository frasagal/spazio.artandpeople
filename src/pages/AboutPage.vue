                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of

                    give you a complete account of the system, and expound the

                    No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because

                    pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
                    extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                    pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is
                    pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
                    toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a

                    physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
